# `<responsive-video>`

A responsive video element with rendition switching, lazy loading and autopause.

The native `<video>` element is good, but it lacks a few features that are 
important for a great user experience. This custom element aims to fix that.

## Why?

- The native `<video>` element doesn't support the `srcset` attribute, `lazy` loading or `autopause`.
- The native `poster` attribute doesn't support `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, `lazy` loading or `async` decoding.

## Features

- Choose optimal rendition based on video container size
- Polyfills media queries on the `<source>` element
- Lazy load video when it enters the viewport
- Automatically pause video when it leaves the viewport
- Implements the proposed [`HTMLMediaElement.videoRenditions`](https://github.com/muxinc/media-tracks) API
- Supports a poster slot for a regular `<img>` element which offers more 
  flexibility than the native `poster` attribute
- Progressive enhancement for `poster` and `video` (optional)
- Class mixin available for custom elements that extend `<video>`

  <video slot="media" controls></video>
</responsive-video>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The rendition switching used here is best for short-form content.  
> For long-form content, you should consider using a streaming protocol like HLS or DASH.


## HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) for rendition switching

A good rule of thumb is to use ABR (Adaptive Bitrate) streaming for content that is longer than 1 minute.

Yes, HLS is more complex to set up than a simple MP4 file and it is a broad topic so it won't be
covered in this README. The most important part relevant to this project is that it can
dynamically adapt to the user's network conditions and device capabilities and the rendition
switching is seamless so the user experience is much better.

Have a read on [howvideo.works](https://howvideo.works/#hls) to understand how HLS works.

[Hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) is a popular JavaScript library to get started with HLS,
or you can use a custom element like [`<hls-video>`](https://github.com/muxinc/hls-video-element) to make it even easier.

## Discussion

`<source>` media queries are supported in the latest browsers but they don't 
dynamically update when the viewport size changes.

Some of these features might come to the native `<video>` element in the future:
